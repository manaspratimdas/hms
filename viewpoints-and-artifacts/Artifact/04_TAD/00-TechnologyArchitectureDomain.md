**Artifacts:**

1.  **Technology Models:**
    
    -   **Hardware and Network Infrastructure Diagrams:**
        -   **AWS Cloud Platform Deployment:**
            -   **Compute Resources:**
                -   **EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service):**  For deploying and managing microservices.
                -   **Auto Scaling Groups:**  To ensure scalability and high availability.
            -   **Storage:**
                -   **S3 Buckets:**  For storing static assets and backups.
                -   **RDS (Relational Database Service):**  For managing the database, deployed in a private subnet.
                -   **Redis Cache:**  For caching frequently accessed data.
            -   **Networking:**
                -   **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):**  To isolate the network environment.
                -   **Subnets:**  Public and private subnets for different components.
                -   **Security Groups:**  To control inbound and outbound traffic.
                -   **AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer):**  For distributing incoming traffic across multiple instances.
            -   **Other Services:**
                -   **CloudFront:**  For content delivery and caching (CDN).
                -   **Route 53:**  For DNS management.
                -   **IAM (Identity and Access Management):**  For managing access permissions.
2.  **Deployment Architecture:**
    
    -   **Production-Grade Deployment:**
        -   **CI/CD Pipeline:**
            -   **Jenkins:**  For continuous integration and continuous deployment.
        -   **Monitoring and Logging:**
            -   **CloudWatch:**  For monitoring application performance and logging.
            -   **CloudTrail:**  For auditing API calls and user activity.
            -   **Prometheus and Grafana:**  For observability and monitoring.
        -   **Backup and Recovery:**
            -   **AWS Backup:**  For automated backup management.
            -   **Disaster Recovery Plan:**  To ensure business continuity.
3.  **Security Architecture:**
    
    -   **Data Encryption:**
        -   **At Rest:**  Using AWS KMS (Key Management Service) for encrypting data stored in S3, RDS, and Redis.
        -   **In Transit:**  Using SSL/TLS for secure communication between components.
    -   **Access Control:**
        -   **IAM Roles and Policies:**  To enforce least privilege access.
        -   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  For enhanced security.
4.  **Integration Architecture:**
    
    -   **APIs and Microservices:**
        -   **API Gateway:**  For managing and securing APIs.
        -   **Lambda Functions:**  For serverless compute and integration tasks.
    -   **Service Mesh:**
        -   **AWS App Mesh:**  For managing microservices communication.
5.  **Observability Components:**
    
    -   **Scaling:**
        -   **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA):**  For scaling microservices in EKS.
        -   **Cluster Autoscaler:**  For scaling the EKS cluster based on demand.
    -   **Logging and Monitoring:**
        -   **Prometheus:**  For collecting metrics.
        -   **Grafana:**  For visualizing metrics and creating dashboards.
        -   **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana):**  For centralized logging and analysis.
